    "Finally shamed that slow payer with #SlothShaming 🦥. Hackathon deadlines don't wait for sloths!",
    "When you're coding fast but your payment's crawling... Time to #SlothShame 🦥",
    "Hackathon motto: code fast, pay faster. For those who didn’t, there’s #SlothShaming 🦥✨",
    "Just called out the slowest payer in our team with #SlothShaming 🦥. Hackathons don’t have time for that!",
    "SlothShaming: because waiting 3 weeks for a hackathon payment feels like waiting 3 years 🦥⌛",
    "Got tired of waiting for payment, so I minted a shame token! 🦥 #SlothShaming #RequestNetwork",
    "If only their code was as slow as their payment... 🦥 #SlothShaming",
    "In hackathons, we run on caffeine, but some people run on turtle time. 🐢 Thank you #SlothShaming!",
    "Another hackathon, another slow payer shamed! 🦥 #ETHWarsaw",
    "Waiting for ETH payments from you feels like watching a sloth learn to code Solidity... slow, painful, and makes me question if block confirmations are actually faster than your promises.",

    "Bro, even a sloth would've paid me faster than you. What are you doing, writing my ETH payment by hand? 🦥💸",
    "You're the sloth of crypto payments, my guy 🦥💸. Send the ETH before the blockchain forgets we even had a deal.",
    "I crushed the hackathon, but the only thing getting hacked is my patience waiting for your ETH payout 🦥⛓️.",
    "I thought winning the bounty was the hard part, but waiting on you to pay up is a whole new level of endurance 🦥💸.",
    "I won the bounty, but it looks like I need to code a time machine just to see that ETH arrive 🦥💸."
